# flutter_liquid_glass
attempt at implementing liquid glass specifications in flutter

Since this is a work in progress, its important to first start with laying out the target and providing resources so that others can contribute. We can assume theres going to be math involved, and possible a need to write custom shaders.
I'd like to layout each individual concept such that it can be implemented incrementally with clear goals

### To-Do  (provide examples)

- [ ] Light Refraction - [Refraction in JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LGa50gncgg)
  - [ ] Gyroscope changes light angle
  - [ ] prismatic edges 
  - [ ] Distortion of layer below

- [ ] Blurring
- [ ] Scale transitioning
- [ ] Color transition from transparent glass to solid color
- [ ] Gooey Liquid / Surface tension pull effect. Save this for last as i dont think its all that important.
